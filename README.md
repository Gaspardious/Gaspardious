👋 Hi there! I'm Dejan, a passionate Frontend Developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden. My journey in tech is fueled by my curiosity and the thrill of building seamless, user-friendly digital experiences. Here's a little more about me:

🌍 Living: Gothenburg, Sweden - a place as vibrant and dynamic as my coding projects.

💻 Studying: Frontend Development is where my heart lies. I'm always diving into new technologies and frameworks, eager to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

🚀 Interests: When I'm not coding, you'll find me:

    🌄 Hiking through breathtaking landscapes, seeking the perfect view. My Sarek hike -21 was awesome!
    ✈️ Traveling the globe, experiencing new cultures. Next destination: Colombia!
    📈 Analyzing the stock market, where I apply my love for patterns and trends to stockpicking. 
    🏋️‍♂️ Pushing my limits at the gym, because I believe in the power of a strong body and mind.
    🎣 Casting a line into the sea, especially during summer for mackerel.

🔍 Looking Forward: Each day is an opportunity to learn something new, face a fresh challenge, and take another step toward mastering my craft. I'm on a continuous quest to innovate, improve, and inspire through my work in Frontend Development.

Feel free to browse through my repositories to see what I've been working on. Let's connect if you share my interests or believe we can collaborate on future projects!
